Hi!

My name is Dustin, and I hope you love this app that's close to my heart: the Outside Inside app, available on Apple TV. This project is born from a personal journey and a desire to redefine the boundaries of our indoor spaces.

For almost two decades, I've navigated the nuances of working from home, specifically from a basement office that lacks the luxury of a window. The absence of natural scenery and daylight led me to yearn for the beauty of the outside world. I sought a solution that not only addressed this gap but also enriched my daily environment. Thus, the concept of Outside Inside was bornâ€”an application designed to simulate the enriching experience of being elsewhere, whether it's amidst nature's beauty or the urban sprawl, by bringing stunning art and personal photo collections to your living space.

Outside Inside is more than just an app; it's a portal to places you'd rather be, especially on days when the weather doesn't permit stepping outside. From serene landscapes to bustling cityscapes, fantasy, or Spring, Summer, Winter or Fall, it brings the essence of the outside world into the comfort of your home. 

My hope is that it enhances your space, mood, and overall well-being by offering a window to the world you wish to see.

Your feedback is invaluable to me, so please don't hesitate to reach out with any ideas, suggestions, or insights you may have.

Warm regards,

Dustin
